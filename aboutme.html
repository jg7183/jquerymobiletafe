  			<p>  <img src="img/pictureofme.jpg" class="thumb-speaker-small" width="120"  height="120"/> I think this picture represents me because of a sense of curiosity and enjoyment I have when it comes to tinkering with computers</p>
             <p><strong> What are your goals for this course?</strong> </p>
<p>To learn how to develop interactive webpages and mobile apps predominatley, but learning the logic behind programming is also a skill that can be applied in problem solving and other areas of life. Not to mention as far as careers go I couldn't see myself doing anything else other then technology.</p>
<p><strong>What are skills and know do you want to learn?</strong></p>
<p><ul>
<li>I want to learn to design mobile apps</li>
<li>I want to learn to design mobile games</li>
<li>I want to gain a better understanding as to how the software and hardware in a computer interact to provide a comfortable end user experience.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>What are your IT career goals?</strong></p>
<p>The type of career I want to enter into is undecided, but it deffinatley will have something to do with technology and computers. I think it would be great to be able to bring app ideas to life (considering we all have so many) and in turn monetize those ideas. Designing a game, is definetly on my to do list and with the phasing out of flash dependencies, now seems like a great time to cross it off.</p>
